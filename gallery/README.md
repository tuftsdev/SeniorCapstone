# Design Notes for Gallery

1. Horizontal scrolling, carousel style, to feel like a gallery
2. Accessible and viewable on desktop, laptop, mobile devices
3. As best as possible, remove the "bounce" on scroll in browser
4. Size of a thumbnail: 600x400px --just enough details yet not an enormous picture
5. Use JPEG: lighter at the cost of compression
6. List students' names? No. Can be scraped and names are pretty visible on poster image.
