	<h2><em>What</em> is Senior Capstone, Really?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Fall semester: requirements gathering and analysis, design, proof of concept</li>
		<li>Spring semester: implementation, professional development, testing, showcase</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><em>Why</em> Senior Capstone? What Purposes Do Senior Capstone Serve?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Students work in teams</li>
		<li>Students work in interdisciplinary teams</li>
		<li>Students work on an open-ended, loosely-defined project</li>
		<li>Students understand the needs of customers and project stakeholders</li>
		<li>Students understand real-world engineering challenges and trade-offs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Senior Capstone shall be integral to help students to attain according to <a

	<h2>The Lessons to Be Learned in Senior Capstone</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Ask questions.</li>
		<li>Your transition from a student to practicing professional.</li>
		<li>Iteration: think, act, do, fail, think, act, do, fail, reflect on failure, either on- or in-action etc.</li>
		<li>Your work product is a reflection on who you are and how you appear to others.</li>
		<li>Your interaction with others establishes who you are and your reputation.</li>
		<li>High standards of work, conduct, and participation are the expectation.</li>
		<li>Design is about merging aesthetics with analysis where the synthesis leads to design.</li>
		<li>Ask questions.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Instructors</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Computer Science: Ming Chow, <a href="mailto:mchow@cs.tufts.edu">mchow@cs.tufts.edu</a></li>
		<li>Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE): Ron Lasser</li>
		<li>Human Factors and Engineering Psychology: Linda Borghesani</li>
		<li>Data Science: Alva Couch</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Senior standing or permissions of instructor</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Requirements for Senior Capstone Project</h2>
	<p>Students are given considerable freedom in their choice of project, to be completed in one academic year.
		However, the following are the requirements for a senior capstone project:
		<ul>
			<li>(NON-NEGOTIABLE) Project <strong>must</strong> be done in a team of at least two people but no more than
				six people. Individual projects not allowed.</li>
			<li>(NON-NEGOTIABLE) Project <strong>must</strong> have a real project sponsor, signed-off by the end of
				September. Project sponsor cannot be instructor of the Senior Capstone course.</li>
			<li>(STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) Project <strong>should</strong> have at least one team member not in the Computer
				Science undergraduate program (major or minor). Interdisciplinary teams are <strong>strongly
					encouraged</strong>.</li>
			<li>(STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) All teams must have a Human Factors element.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Senior Capstone Integration</h2>
		<p>ECE Senior Design is harmonized with the Capstone classes in Computer Science (being taught by Ming Chow) and
			with Engineering Psychology (being taught by Linda Borghesani). Teams are to be 3 to 6 students. By
			harmonized we mean that all project deliverables are identical across all three classes, but specific course
			work assignments are not. This allows for multi-disciplinary team projects which provide excellent
			experience of working with people from different technical backgrounds. This experience is very valuable in
			industry. You are welcome to select any project.</p>

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions by Students</h2>
		<p>Q: Can Computer Science seniors in the School Arts &amp; Sciences take Senior Capstone?
			A: Absolutely, strongly encouraged! In the past, Computer Science seniors in Arts &amp; Sciences shunned
			Senior Capstone. We have always wanted more Arts &amp; Sciences students take Senior Capstone.</p>
		<p>Q: Can a JumboCode project count as a senior capstone project?<br />
			A: Yes --at long last. As of September 2019:
			<ul>
				<li>Any JumboCode project is eligible to become a "capstone project" - i.e., a project manager or
					designer may get credit for any JumboCode project.</li>
				<li>CS students serving as JumboCode Project managers are eligible to get Senior Capstone credit, by
					applying and being accepted through JumboCode’s project manager application process in mid-March.
				</li>
				<li>Human Factors students are also eligible to get credit through serving as a UI/UX designer on a
					JumboCode project, by applying and being accepted through the designer member application in
					September.</li> <!-- Thanks to Lexi Walker for her work on these laws -->
			</ul>
			<p>Q: Will we be meeting every class day?<br />
				A: No. See schedule below.</p>
			<p>Q: Am I allowed to do a project with a company?<br />
				A: Absolutely! We have a few projects from corporate partners and friends. This is great opportunity to
				develop relationships with a company, and learn skills that are helpful for managing a team or starting
				a company.</p>
			<p>Q: Who owns the intellectual property?<br />
				A: Generally speaking, you, the students, own the intellectual property.</p>
			<p>Q: Is there an archive of past capstone projects for us to see to understand the scope of a capstone
				project?<br />
				A: Yes. <a href="archive/">Here you go.</a>
			</p>

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions by Project Sponsors</h2>
			<p>Q: What are the requirements for the company/person who submit the idea, assuming it is chosen? I'm
				curious of the time typical time commitments.<br />
				A: We expect a time commitment of no more than 1 hour from project sponsors per week.
			</p>
			<p>Q: Does a project tend to revolve around software typically?<br />
				A: Software has been the predominant focus. We are encouraging more projects that involve hardware and
				interdisciplinary projects (e.g., Data Science + Cyber Security).
			</p>
			<p>Q: What do project sponsor(s) contribute to a project besides acting as a client for the project?<br />
				A: (1) Occasionally provide the Capstone instructor(s) feedback about team's work including
				professionalism, progress, quality of deliverables, etc., and (2) answer any questions from team
				regarding scope of the project, requirements, design, etc.</p>
			<p>Q: Who owns the intellectual property?<br />
				A: Generally speaking, the students, own the intellectual property.</p>

			<h2>Course Infrastructure</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>This course website</strong> - Serves as public record. This is not really possible with
					Canvas. We are not using Canvas for this class.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="https://piazza.com/tufts/fall2019/capstone" target="_blank">Piazza</a></strong> -
					For discussions, announcements, and files not to be made public.</li>
				<li><strong>Box</strong> - For file uploads and submissions.</li>
				<li><strong>GitHub</strong> or <strong>GitLab</strong> - For source code and status updates.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
			<p>Project ideas are posted on Piazza. The reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>List of project ideas was growing too long.</li>
				<li>Some projects cannot be made publicly available.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A project sponsored by industry is good for several reasons including industry experience, industry
				contacts for your network, potential job or reference. And a multi-disciplinary is an added advantage.
				Projects must be selected ideally by September 20th and project proposals are due by October 1st.</p>

			<h2>Status Reports</h2>
			<p>Starting on Friday, October 4th, a status report is due from each team each week until the last week of
				classes for the semester. Instructions:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Format:
					<ol>
						<li>Fails of the week</li>
						<li>Successes of the week</li>
						<li>Difficulties this week</li>
						<li>Goals for next week</li>
					</ol>
				<li>One page MAX</li>
				<li>One submission per team</li>
				<li>PDF format</li>
				<li>To be written as a team</li>
				<li>To be submitted to Box</li>
			</ul>
